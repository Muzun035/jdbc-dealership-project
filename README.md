# Car Dealership Management System

## Description of the Project
The Car Dealership Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the management of a dealership's inventory and contracts. It offers features to add, view, and search vehicles based on various attributes. Additionally, the system allows users to manage and store sales and lease contracts. The application integrates with a MySQL database, ensuring secure and scalable data management.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles by price range so that I can find options within my budget.
- As a user, I want to filter vehicles by make and model so I can find specific brands or types.
- As a user, I want to search vehicles by year range to explore options based on the vehicle's age.
- As a user, I want to filter vehicles by color so that I can select cars that match my preferences.
- As a user, I want to search vehicles by mileage range to find options with minimal usage.
- As a user, I want to filter vehicles by type (e.g., sedan, SUV) so that I can focus on specific categories.
- As a user, I want to add new vehicles to the system so I can keep the inventory up-to-date with new arrivals.
- As a user, I want to create and manage sales and lease contracts to track customer agreements and manage transactions.
